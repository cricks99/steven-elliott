                    <h2>The American Dream in Action</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Steven Elliott's story is the American Dream in action - from humble beginnings to military service to successful entrepreneurship, all leading to a calling to serve his country in Congress.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Early Life & Work Ethic</h3>
                    <p>Steven Elliott was born in Windsor, Ontario. His father was a Canadian construction worker, and his mother was an American secretary. His family lived in the Detroit area until he was 3 years old. They then moved to Colorado for his father's work as a union Glazier for 4 years. At the age of 8, Steven and his family returned to the Detroit area, purchasing a home in Roseville.</p>
                    
                    <p>Steven learned that if he wanted anything in life, he had to work for it. He started working at the age of 12 and never stopped. He mowed lawns, bagged groceries, washed dishes, fried chicken at KFC, cooked at a bowling alley, and served as a caddy at the local golf club.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Military Service</h3>
                    <p>Two weeks after his high school graduation, Steven joined the United States Marine Corps, just three days after his 18th birthday. His service in the Marines changed his life forever, and for the better. Steven served 4 years in the Marine Corps as a Logistics Specialist at Camp Pendleton in Southern California.</p>
                    
                    <p>He was assigned to the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Intelligence Group (SRIG), ensuring all combat essential equipment was operational. He was attached to the Army Paratrooper School in Fort Benning, Georgia, as well as deployed to the US Southern Border to track drug smugglers, human traffickers, and illegal entrants.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Business Success</h3>
                    <p>After completing his military service, Steven went to work in the private sector as a personal trainer and selling cars at a local car dealership in Royal Oak. In 2001, he took out a loan on his home to start his own business, American Pride Tattoo Studio. That single tattoo studio grew to 6 throughout the Detroit area.</p>
                    
                    <p>Steven made the innovative decision to not only offer tattoos, but also tattoo removal in his shops. Quickly seeing the success of offering aesthetics work, in 2012, Steven founded a full service aesthetics center, which he owns and operates to this day; Rochester Laser Center.</p>
                    
                    <p>Steven has enjoyed a successful business career by investing in any businesses' most valuable asset: people. He offered individuals the opportunity to learn a trade and build a career. Through his businesses, Steven has given back to his community by contributing to many local events, charities, and organizations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>A Patriot's Calling</h3>
                    <p>Steven is not only a veteran and businessman, he is a patriot who loves his country and believes that America is exceptional. He has seen the American Dream become out of reach for too many due to rising inflation, increasing crime, poor education, erosion of freedoms, economic stagnation, high taxes and regulations.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is for these reasons that Steven has decided to run for United States Congress to challenge the establishment and fight for hard working Americans.</p>
