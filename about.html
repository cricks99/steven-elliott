            <div class="bio-section">
                <h2>Early Life & Foundation</h2>
                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p class="lead">Steven Elliott was born in Windsor, Ontario, to a Canadian construction worker father and American secretary mother. His family's journey would shape the values that define him today.</p>
                    
                    <div class="bio-image-right">
                        <img src="images /I 1 .png" alt="Steven Elliott professional portrait" />
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>His family lived in the Detroit area until he was 3 years old, then moved to Colorado for his father's work as a union Glazier for 4 years. At the age of 8, Steven and his family returned to the Detroit area, purchasing a home in Roseville.</p>
                    
                    <p>Steven learned early that if he wanted anything in life, he had to work for it. He started working at the age of 12 and never stopped. His early jobs included mowing lawns, bagging groceries, washing dishes, frying chicken at KFC, cooking at a bowling alley, and serving as a caddy at the local golf club. These experiences instilled in him the work ethic and determination that would carry him through life.</p>

            <!-- Military Service -->
            <div class="bio-section">
                <h2>Military Service & Honor</h2>
                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p class="lead">Two weeks after his high school graduation, Steven joined the United States Marine Corps, just three days after his 18th birthday. His service in the Marines changed his life forever, and for the better.</p>
                    
                    <div class="bio-image-left">

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Steven served 4 years in the Marine Corps as a Logistics Specialist at Camp Pendleton in Southern California. He was assigned to the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Intelligence Group (SRIG), ensuring all combat essential equipment was operational.</p>
                    
                    <p>His military service included specialized training at the Army Paratrooper School in Fort Benning, Georgia, and deployment to the US Southern Border to track drug smugglers, human traffickers, and illegal entrants. This frontline experience with border security challenges informs his strong stance on immigration policy today.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Marine Corps instilled in Steven the core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment—principles that continue to guide his decisions in business and his vision for public service.</p>

            <!-- Business Success -->

                <h2>Entrepreneurial Success</h2>
                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p class="lead">After completing his military service, Steven transitioned to the private sector, working as a personal trainer and selling cars at a local dealership in Royal Oak. But his entrepreneurial spirit called him to bigger challenges.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 2001, Steven took a calculated risk that would define his business career. He took out a loan on his home to start American Pride Tattoo Studio. Through hard work, innovation, and dedication to customer service, that single tattoo studio grew to 6 locations throughout the Detroit area.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Steven's business acumen showed early when he made the innovative decision to offer both tattoo application and removal services—the first in the area to do so. Recognizing the growing demand for aesthetic services, in 2012 he founded Rochester Laser Center, a full-service aesthetics facility he continues to own and operate today.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout his business career, Steven has invested in people—offering individuals opportunities to learn trades and build careers. His businesses have contributed to many local events, charities, and organizations, reflecting his belief that successful businesses have a responsibility to give back to their communities.</p>

                <h2>A Patriot's Calling</h2>
                <div class="bio-content">
                    <p class="lead">Steven Elliott is not only a veteran and businessman—he is a patriot who loves his country and believes America is exceptional. But he has witnessed the American Dream becoming increasingly out of reach for too many hardworking families.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through his business interactions and community involvement, Steven has seen firsthand how government policies are making life harder for ordinary Americans. Rising inflation, increasing crime, declining education quality, erosion of constitutional freedoms, economic stagnation, and burdensome taxes and regulations have motivated him to step forward.</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Steven's unique combination of experiences—growing up in a working-class family, serving his country in the Marines, and building successful businesses—gives him the perspective needed to effectively represent Michigan's 10th Congressional District.</p>
                    
                    <p>His decision to run for Congress stems from a deep conviction that America's best days are ahead if we return to the principles that made our nation great: individual liberty, free enterprise, personal responsibility, strong defense, and secure borders.</p>
